# What is Azure DevOps?

Azure DevOps supports a collaborative culture and set of processes that bring together developers, project managers, and contributors to develop software. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.

You can work in the cloud using Azure DevOps Services or on-premises using Azure DevOps Server. For more information, see Differences between Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server.

Azure DevOps provides integrated features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client. You can use all the services included with Azure DevOps, or choose just what you need to complement your existing workflows.

## Choose Azure DevOps Server

Azure DevOps Server supports integration with GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. Choose on-premises Azure DevOps Server when:
